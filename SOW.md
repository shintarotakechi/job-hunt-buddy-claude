# Statement of Work (SOW)

## Task: Restrict AI Model Usage to Gemini 2.5 Flash

### Current State
- Line 304 in specification.md currently states: "OpenAI GPT-4 API or Anthropic Claude API"
- No specific cost considerations mentioned for AI model selection
- Model choice is open-ended without restriction

### Proposed Changes
1. Update specification.md line 304 to specify exclusive use of Gemini 2.5 Flash
2. Add cost consideration rationale to the AI Services section
3. Ensure consistency across all documentation

### Rationale
- Cost optimization is critical for sustainable operations
- Gemini 2.5 Flash provides adequate capabilities at significantly lower cost
- Restriction ensures predictable AI operational costs

### Implementation Plan
1. Locate and update AI model references in specification.md
2. Add cost justification section
3. Verify no other files reference alternative AI models

### Expected Outcome
- specification.md will clearly mandate Gemini 2.5 Flash as the only approved AI model
- Cost considerations will be explicitly documented
- No ambiguity in AI model selection for implementation
