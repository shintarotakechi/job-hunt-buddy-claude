# Statement of Work (SOW)

## Task: Update Documentation to Replace Stagehand with Playwright.NET

### Objective
Update all project documentation to replace Stagehand references with Playwright.NET as the chosen browser automation solution.

### Scope
1. Update architecture.md - Replace Stagehand with Playwright.NET
2. Update specification.md for browser automation references
3. Update implementation-roadmap.md with Playwright.NET
4. Update initial_need.md technology stack
5. Verify no Stagehand references remain

### Implementation Decision

#### Final Browser Automation Choice: Playwright.NET + Semantic Kernel

**Rationale:**
- **Native C# support** - No TypeScript/Node.js dependencies
- **Cross-browser support** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **AI resilience** - Semantic Kernel adds self-healing capabilities
- **Zero licensing costs** - Apache 2.0 license (free)
- **Consistent .NET stack** - Maintains architectural unity

### Status
Currently updating all documentation files to reflect this decision.

## Previous Task: Evaluate Browser Automation Tools for JobHunt AI

### Analysis Complete ✅

#### Stagehand Analysis
- **Pros**: AI-powered resilience, self-healing selectors, natural language automation
- **Critical Issue**: TypeScript-only, no C#/.NET support
- **Verdict**: Creates same language conflict as Mastra

#### Recommended Solution: Playwright.NET + Semantic Kernel

**Architecture:**
```csharp
Playwright.NET (Browser Automation)
    +
Semantic Kernel (AI Resilience Layer)
    =
Self-healing browser automation in pure C#
```

**Benefits:**
- Native C# support (no language conflicts)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- AI-powered selector adaptation
- Zero licensing costs (all open-source)
- Consistent .NET ecosystem

### Implementation Pattern
1. Use Playwright.NET for core browser automation
2. Add Semantic Kernel for AI-powered resilience:
   - Dynamic selector generation when DOM changes
   - Natural language data extraction
   - Self-healing automation scripts
3. Integrate with Hangfire for scheduled crawling jobs

## Previous Task: Update Documentation to Reflect Semantic Kernel + Hangfire Architecture

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All documentation has been updated:
- architecture.md: Updated orchestration details
- specification.md: Updated workflow requirements
- implementation-roadmap.md: Updated Phase 6
- initial_need.md: Updated technology stack
- No Mastra references remain in documentation

## Previous Analysis Summary

### Frameworks Evaluated
1. **Dify 2.0** - Not recommended (architectural mismatch, overkill)
2. **Mastra** - Not recommended (TypeScript-only, language conflict)
3. **Semantic Kernel + Hangfire** - RECOMMENDED (best fit for .NET architecture)
4. **Stagehand** - Not recommended (TypeScript-only, same issue as Mastra)
5. **Playwright.NET** - RECOMMENDED for browser automation

### Cost Analysis Results
- All frameworks have $0 licensing costs
- Real differentiator is development/operational complexity
- Maintaining single .NET stack offers lowest TCO

### Key Findings
- TypeScript-only tools (Mastra, Stagehand) conflict with .NET architecture
- Microsoft's Semantic Kernel provides AI capabilities in native C#
- Playwright.NET offers enterprise-grade browser automation
- Combining these creates powerful, consistent architecture
