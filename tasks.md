# Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated specification.md to restrict AI model to Gemini 2.5 Flash only
- [x] Evaluated Dify 2.0 for JobHunt AI platform - Not recommended
- [x] Analyzed Mastra workflow orchestration - Replaced with Semantic Kernel + Hangfire
- [x] Evaluated Stagehand browser automation - Replaced with Playwright.NET
- [x] Updated all documentation to reflect final architecture decisions
- [x] Added Hangfire schema tables to database-schema.md
- [x] Added Semantic Kernel agent state table (ai.agent_states)
- [x] Verified consistency across all .md files

## Final Architecture Review Complete ✅

### All Documentation Files Reviewed and Updated:
1. **architecture.md** - Updated with Semantic Kernel, Hangfire, Playwright.NET
2. **specification.md** - Enhanced with AI resilience details
3. **implementation-roadmap.md** - Aligned with new architecture
4. **database-schema.md** - Added Hangfire and agent state tables
5. **initial_need.md** - Updated technology stack
6. **api-specification.md** - No changes needed (API-agnostic)
7. **SOW.md** - Documents all decisions
8. **tasks.md** - This file, tracking all changes
9. **CHANGELOG.md** - Complete history of changes

### Final Technology Stack (100% .NET/C#)

| Component | Solution | License | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| **AI Model** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Pay-per-use | ✅ Documented |
| **AI Orchestration** | Semantic Kernel | MIT ($0) | ✅ Documented |
| **Job Scheduling** | Hangfire | LGPL v3 ($0) | ✅ Documented |
| **Browser Automation** | Playwright.NET | Apache 2.0 ($0) | ✅ Documented |
| **Backend** | ASP.NET Core 8 | MIT ($0) | ✅ Documented |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15 | MIT ($0) | ✅ Documented |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL License ($0) | ✅ Enhanced |
| **Cache** | Redis | BSD ($0) | ✅ Documented |

### Key Architectural Decisions Confirmed

1. **No TypeScript on Backend**
   - Eliminated Mastra (TypeScript-only)
   - Eliminated Stagehand (TypeScript-only)
   - Frontend-only TypeScript (Next.js)

2. **Microsoft Stack for AI**
   - Semantic Kernel for AI orchestration
   - Playwright.NET for browser automation
   - Both have Microsoft backing

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - All frameworks: $0 licensing
   - Single AI provider: Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Pay only for API usage

4. **Database Enhancements**
   - Added Hangfire schema for job persistence
   - Added ai.agent_states for Semantic Kernel
   - Complete schema documentation

- [ ] Install Playwright.NET

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Create Semantic Kernel agents
- [ ] Configure Hangfire jobs
- [ ] Implement Playwright crawlers
- [ ] Build AI resilience layer

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Google OAuth setup
- [ ] Google Sheets API integration
- [ ] Google Calendar API integration
- [ ] Email service configuration

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration testing

## Summary

All documentation has been thoroughly reviewed and updated. The architecture is now:
- **100% consistent** across all documentation
- **Pure .NET/C#** backend (no TypeScript dependencies)
- **Cost-optimized** with free frameworks and single AI provider
- **Production-ready** with mature, enterprise-backed tools
- **Fully documented** with implementation details

The project is ready to move from planning to implementation phase.
