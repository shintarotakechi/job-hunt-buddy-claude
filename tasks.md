# Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated specification.md to restrict AI model to Gemini 2.5 Flash only
  - Modified line 304 in AI Services section to specify Gemini 2.5 Flash as exclusive model
  - Added cost optimization rationale
  - Removed fallback provider options
- [x] Updated specification.md line 64 to specify Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI-Powered Application Generation
- [x] Updated architecture.md to replace OpenAI/Anthropic references with Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Line 191: Changed LLM Gateway to single provider
  - Line 540: Changed AI service to Gemini 2.5 Flash
- [x] Updated implementation-roadmap.md to use Gemini 2.5 Flash exclusively
  - Line 250: Changed AI integration to Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Line 600: Changed AI services provider to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Update API implementation to use Gemini API when development begins
- [ ] Configure Gemini API keys and authentication
- [ ] Implement prompt optimization for Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- [ ] Set up cost monitoring for Gemini API usage
- [ ] Test Gemini 2.5 Flash performance for all AI tasks
- [ ] Create fallback error handling (without alternate models)

## Notes
- Cost optimization is the primary driver for this model restriction
- Gemini 2.5 Flash provides adequate capabilities at significantly lower cost
- No fallback to other models to maintain cost predictability
